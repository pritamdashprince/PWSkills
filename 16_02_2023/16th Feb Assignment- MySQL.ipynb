    "A database is an organized collection of data, stored and managed in a structured format to enable efficient retrieval, modification, and querying of data.

    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data structure: SQL databases store data in a tabular format with fixed columns, while NoSQL databases use flexible data structures, including documents, key-value pairs, and graph structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schema: SQL databases use a schema to define the structure of the data, while NoSQL databases do not have a fixed schema, and the data structure can be changed at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Query language: SQL databases use SQL as a query language for managing and querying data, while NoSQL databases use their own query language, which may be based on JSON or other formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scalability: NoSQL databases are more scalable than SQL databases and can handle large amounts of data and traffic more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use cases: SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require scalability, performance, and flexibility."
