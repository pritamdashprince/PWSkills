    "Multiprocessing in Python is a technique of parallel programming that involves the use of multiple processors or cores in a computer system to perform several tasks concurrently. In this technique, multiple processes are created, and each process runs independently and can perform different tasks at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of multiprocessing is that it allows programs to take advantage of the multiple cores and processors available on modern computers, and thus can significantly improve the performance of computationally intensive tasks. It is particularly useful for programs that need to process large amounts of data or perform complex calculations."

    "* Resource utilization: In multiprocessing, each process gets its own separate memory space and system resources, such as CPU and memory. In contrast, in multithreading, all threads share the same memory space and system resources, which can result in resource contention and potential performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Concurrency: In multiprocessing, processes are truly concurrent, meaning they can run simultaneously on different cores or processors. In contrast, in multithreading, threads run concurrently but not necessarily simultaneously, and the operating system decides when to switch between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complexity: Multiprocessing can be more complex to implement than multithreading because processes need to communicate with each other using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes or queues. In contrast, multithreading allows for simpler communication between threads because they share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fault tolerance: Multiprocessing offers better fault tolerance than multithreading because a failure in one process will not affect the other processes. In contrast, a failure in one thread can potentially cause the entire program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performance: In some cases, multiprocessing can provide better performance than multithreading, especially for CPU-bound tasks that can be parallelized. However, multiprocessing also has higher overhead compared to multithreading, and there may be a cost associated with creating and managing multiple processes."
